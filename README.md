# Path of the Light Yoga Studio Study
This project was created as part of the CS 315 - Introduction to Web Design course at Jacksonville State University, under the guidance of Professor Keith Foster. It served as a practical learning experience to reinforce HTML5 and CSS concepts learned from the case studies in the book "Basics of Web Design" by Terry Ann Felke-Morris (6th Edition).
